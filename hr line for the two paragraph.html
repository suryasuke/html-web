<h2>Definition for paragaraph</h2>
<p>A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph.
     It should<br /> be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about.
      Words chosen <br />for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous
      as readers will decide to read further based on<br /> this.
      It is not necessary to write the topicsentence at the
    beginning of the paragraph. It can be<br /> put anywhere, as long as it reflects the main topic. For instance, 
     if you mention that you are <br />going to talk about the advantages of using the hand sanitizer,
     then in supporting sentence you<br /> should only talk about advantages, not the features or anything else<br /></p>
