<p>A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph.
     It should be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about.
      Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous
      as readers will decide to read further based on this.
      It is not necessary to write the topicsentence at the
    beginning of the paragraph. It can be put anywhere, as long as it reflects the main topic. For instance, 
     if you mention that you are going to talk about the advantages of using the hand sanitizer,

They predict a boom of round 2C to 6C with the aid of the 21st century.
